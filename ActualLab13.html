        <p  style="background-color: rgb(198, 218, 27);font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> 
            Flipkart was founded in October 2007 in Bangalore by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees.<br>
            The company was started from a two-bedroom apartment in Koramangala, Bengaluru. The initial investment was provided by their families,
            which was INR 2 Lakh from each family.<br> The website was kicked off in October 2007 and the company was only limited to selling books at that time country-wide shipping.<br>
            Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.<br> Flipkart acquired WeRead in 2010 from Lulu.com that helped 
            it build its foundational strength which was the digital retail of books.<br> This space was otherwise only shared by very limited number of players at that time 
            in the market, such as Landmark and Infibeam.<br> Flipkart used aggressive discounts and focused on customer service to move towards a leadership position in the 
            market. We Read consisted of a large network of readers (~3 million) with around 60 million books.<br> The platform also noted information that was user generated.<br>
            such as people marking a book as favorite or leaving a review or rating.<br> WeRead, because of its utility to community and independent nature maintained its brand
            identity even after acquisition</p>
